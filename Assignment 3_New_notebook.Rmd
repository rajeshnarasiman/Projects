#  The dataset uswages is drawn as a sample from the Current Population Survey in 1988.


```{r}
#Question 1
#load data
library(faraway)
data(uswages)

#numerical summary
summary(uswages)

# graphic summary for continous variable, use scatterplot; for binary variables, use histogram
#Scatter Plot
plot.default(uswages[,1],main = "Real weekly wages in dollars",xlab = "ID",ylab = "")
#Histogram
hist(uswages[,4],main = "Race", xlab = "0=White 1=Black")

#By reading the summary above we can see the following observations,
#1. The dataset has experience values which is less that 0, we can remove these anomalies and proceed furthey with our analysis.
#2. We can see there are few standard deviation are above the mean. So we can delete the wages which are 3 standard deviations above the mean.

#Cleaning process.
clean = subset(uswages, wage<1987.616 & exper>=0)

# name variables

edu=c(clean[,2])

#Question 2

wage.lm=lm(wage~edu, clean)

wage.lm

#Question 3:
lm_wage=lm(wage~edu+exp, clean)
lm_wage
# For every increase in education level there will be an increase of 50.869 in the respondent (Wage) and viceversa.

#Question 4:
# Sample code for regression and comparison of models with “anova” function
null=lm(wage~1,clean)
hypo=anova(null,lm_wage)
hypo
# performing F-test for 90% conf interval
fstat=var.test(wage,edu+exp,data=clean,conf.level = 0.90)
fstat
#P-value based on F-test
fstat$p.value
#fstat= predict(hypo,interval="confidence", level=0.90)

#The p-value of F-test is <2.2e-16(i.e., almost 0), which is less than the significance level of 0.05. 
#In conclusion, we can say that there is a significant difference between the two variances.So we reject the null hypothesis.

#Question 5:
# For checking the confidence interval of 90%, I am converting the data to a data frame with experience of 5 years and education of 8 years.
predi = data.frame(exp=c(5), edu=c(8))
# Make predictions
exp_edu=predict(lm_wage, predi,interval="confidence", level=0.90)
exp_edu
#We can tell that 90% of the time, the weekly wages will be in the range of 177.8701 to 235.9848.
#Fitted value is 206.9274.

#From the analysis above, we see that the wages are not significantly separated values ie the ranges are not apart, but the wages are overlapping between the regions. Hence, the salaries are not significantly different.
