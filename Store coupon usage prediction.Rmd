#Question 1:
#Model 1: We shall use HasCard and Spends as predictor variables and see if our variable are significant. We can see that the significance is very low or we can say that there is no significance.

#Model 2: lets try to use intercept as 0 and the other 2 variables to check if this giving any significant value. We can see that only spends variable has more significance

# Model 4: As we can see that the spends has more significant than other variable we shall impute 0 for intercept and keep only spends as respondant.

# since model 4 is very significant for our data we shall plot the graphs for that

#As per the below plot we can say that the coupons are used even if the customer has card or no card. But the coupons are definetly used when the customer has card.

#Question 2:
nullm <- glm(UsesCoupon ~ 1, family = binomial,data=simmons)

x= 1-logLik(logist_3)/logLik(nullm)
# As the AIC value is not reliable as we have low value for model 1 where the variables are not significant and high for model 4 where the Spend variable is much significant.

#We have pseudo R squared value is not in the range( 0.2 and 0.4) but still its reasonable.

#This function converts logist to probability.

  prob <- odds / (1 + odds)

#Gives the porbability value of the intercept and coefficient
